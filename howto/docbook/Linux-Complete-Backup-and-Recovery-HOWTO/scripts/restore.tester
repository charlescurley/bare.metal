# 2007-05-22: Changes for FHS compliance. Removed commented out
# references to ZIP drives.

# 2006-04-14: Use the script ../scripts/get.target to determine the
# host name. This makes the script more general, and maybe we can run
# it from one place & determine the host name from the directory
# name.

# Get the host name of the computer to be backed up and other info.
. ../scripts/get.target

bunzip2 -dc $TARGET.tar.bz2 | ssh $host "umask 000 ; cd / ; tar -xpkf - "

# bunzip2 -dc $host.dos.$DATE.tar.bz2 | ssh $host "umask 000 ;\
# mount /mnt/dosc ; cd / ; tar -xpkf - "

# Note libata issue! We boot to /dev/sda, not /dev/hda, as IDE drives
# now show up as SCSI drives.
