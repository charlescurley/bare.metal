Debian packages you may want, among others:

apt install make jade jadetex docbook ldp-docbook-dsssl lynx

This directory has the SGML source and related files for the Linux
Complete Backup and Recovery HOWTO. It should have everything you need
by way of source to build the HOWTO in various formats such as pdf,
HTML and TeX.

Run "make clean", then "make scripts". That will build some
directories and do some other stuff for you. Then you can run "make
all" to build the whole kazoo, or "make html" to build just the html
files, etc. For a complete list of the available targets, see the file
Makefile.

Making the .dvi and .pdf files may fail. Simply run the same make
command again.

The sources for the scripts are in the subdirectory src. Copies
exactly as I use them on my test environment are in the subdirectory
scripts.

With the small amount of editing described in the HOWTO the scripts
should be ready for you to use. They are here so that the SGML source
for the HOWTO can incorporate them by inclusion, rather like C's
"#include". Before the SGML translator code can use the scripts, some
SGML cruft has to be added to each one. The cooked scripts end up in
the directory "cooked".

You may add scripts to the "scripts" subdirectory. Add them to the
file src/Makefile. Make sure you call the new script from "cooked" or
it won't pass SGML verification. See the <!ENTITY ... > tags at the
top of the SGML source file for examples.

The target "clean" gets rid of intermediate files like the cooked
scripts and all of the final production. Use it to be sure you have
killed off any intermediate cruft.

You may have to edit the paths to the style sheets. This works on
Debian 9.4 "stretch". BTW, I use GNU Make version 4.1.

Enjoy. Happy backing up.
