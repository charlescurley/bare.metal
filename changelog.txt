Changes for 2.15

* NVMe friendly searches for drves.

* Some installations of Debian 11 (Bullseye) play dumb games with file
  permissions in /run/user/1000. This change avoids that problem at
  the cost of not backing up all of /run.

* More information about disks using lsblk. Possibly useful for
  reconstructing complicated setups we would otherwise miss.

* A more rigorous pattern to search on for multiple processors.

* Deal with /run/user/*/doc permissions nonsense.
